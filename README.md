#Front-End Development Coding Challenge
Use your favorite JS frameworks to develop a simple single-page application that:

1. ✅ Allows a user to type a location into an input field
2. ✅ Presents a map of the location entered
3. ✅ Hits the forecast.io api to get the forecast for the next hour and displays in a user-friendly manner:  
    a. ✅ The forecast for todays conditions  
    b. ✅ The minutely forecast data for the next hour  

✅ Include a test/tests to prove your application functions as expected.
