#Front-End Development Coding Challenge
Use your favorite JS frameworks to develop a simple single-page application that:

1. ✅ Allows a user to type a location into an input field
2. ✅ Presents a map of the location entered
3. 🔴 Hits the forecast.io api to get the forecast for the next hour and displays in a user-friendly manner:
    a. 🔴 The forecast for todays conditions
    b. 🔴 The minutely forecast data for the next hour

🔴 Include a test/tests to prove your application functions as expected.
